This repo contains some of the exercies/projects I did when learning about ML with PyTorch.

The first one is Boston housing price dataset problem. I simply use linear regression with one layer to practice coding up a ML model.

The second one is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. I just use logistic regression (binary classification) with one layer to predict onset of diabetes
